using the following guidelines, create 3 question and answer pairs

Questions
Focus on key details or insights within the context section
Create diverse questions. Include a variety of question types like fact-based, reasoning, or clarification questions.
Each question should be self-contained, including all needed information, and not rely on any additional context (such as multi-turn chat history)
Use clear and concise language
The questions should reflect the kinds of questions we expect the aligned model to be able to answer.

Answers
Avoid single word or yes/no answers. Even if the question has a one-word answer, provide a full sentence. This sets the style for how the teacher model will generate similar pairs of Q&A.
Make sure the answers are directly relevant to the questions.
Answers should be detailed.
If the answer requires reasoning, ensure to include the step-by-step reasoning within the answer content.
Try to reference the question for additional clarity.
Answers should represent the type of answers the model should be able to provide based on the context chunk.
Answers should not be verbatim from the context section as the model will learn to extract instead of reason and generate.
Answers must include facts contained in context and not reference facts outside of context or the model will learn to hallucinate.
