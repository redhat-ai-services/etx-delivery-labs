# 📘 Section 1.2 – Validating and Finalizing `qna.yaml`

In this section, you will complete and validate your `qna.yaml` file to ensure it meets taxonomy standards for use in tuning.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. ✅ Add the **`document`** section to your `qna.yaml` file, which should include:
   - `repo`
   - `commit`
   - `patterns`

2. ✅ **Validate your YAML** using a linting tool:
   - [YAML Lint (Online)](http://www.yamllint.com/)
   - VS Code extension: `YAML Language Support by Red Hat`
   - CLI tool: `yamllint`

   ⚠️ Fix any syntax or formatting errors before proceeding.

3. ✅ **Validate the taxonomy** using **InstructLab tools**:
   - Use either a local install or containerized version
   - Check for structure, schema, and logic errors
   - Correct any reported issues

4. ✅ Once your `qna.yaml` is fully validated, **commit it to your GitHub repository**
