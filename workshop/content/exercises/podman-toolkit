## 📂 2. Create a Local Directory to Mount

This shared directory will be accessible from both your host and the container.

```bash
mkdir ~/podman-shared
```

---

## 🚀 3. Run the Container

Mount the shared volume and expose the container’s UI port:

```bash
podman run -dit \
  --name ai-tools-container \
  -p 5001:5001 \
  -v ~/podman-shared:/mnt/shared \
  quay.io/bcarr/ai-tools
```

## 💻 4. Exec into the Running Container

Use `bash` to open a shell inside the container:

```bash
podman exec -it ai-tools-container bash
```

Now you're inside the container and ready to explore or run AI tools.
